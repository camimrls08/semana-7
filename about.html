                                From an early age I have captivated the shapes, colors and textures. World visual sensory stimuli son and Constants in my development, especially when I am in contact with nature.
                                During the course of my life designing and drawing it has been the means I use to share my vision with others. With my training at school and as a designer at the University who developed a capacity computers feeling very comfortable working with different design applications.

                                process Before starting a painting, or Design Writing is read all I can about the subject joyful on the canvas or in writing. I do not want just capture that image or idea with the pencil; Give DETAILS & color prefer to give society life once again.

                                I make art in various creative media such as drawing, writing and designing. I feel my biggest challenge is to have power of expressing and that others understand me, when you read or see my work The viewers can understand sin Having to explain. Whenever I try to make each project, esta breathe life ie designs, ideas, and views innvaciones are exposed at my work.
